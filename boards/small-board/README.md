# *Small* Board
Configurable board with 1 intermittence module capable of drive 2 LED-strings.
The light intensity can be varied via trimmers T2/T3,
and the period of intermittence can be varied using the T1 trimmer, between about 5 and 20 seconds.
The intermittence module can be plugget to none, one or both the drivers via J1/J2 jumpers.
