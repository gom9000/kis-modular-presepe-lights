# *Keep It Simple*

# Modular Presepe Lights
A set of simple modular circuits for the lighting of the presepe.
<br/>
The idea is to make a very simple lights controller, with a modular approach depending on the needs, to drive low-current (and short) LED strings, with an external supply voltage between 12 and 15 VDC.

The concept behind *Keep-It-Simple* is to build simple solutions using only a few general-purpose, easy-to-manage components, without MCUs or programmable devices.



## Modules

### LED Driver Module
Is the only mandatory module, implemented with a LM317 configured as a constant current source.
This simple configuration is capable to drive a LED string that has a drop voltage of less than $Vin$ minus a few volts.

The output current of this circuit is:

$$ I_{out} = 1.25/R_{s} $$


### Intermittence Module
A variable frequency astable multivibrator that acts as intermittence, implemented with a 555 timer.

A rectangular voltage signal of approximately $Vout = Vcc-1.5V$ is obtained as output.
<br/>
Circuit timing equations are:

$$ period = 0,69*(R_{1} + 2R_{2})*C $$

$$ dutycycle = \large\frac{R_{1} + R_{2}}{R_{1} + 2R_{2}} $$


### Firelight Module
A fixed frequency astable multivibrator "disturbed" by a simple relaxaction oscillator, to emulate the irregular tremolo of firelight.

### Starlight Module
The same circuit of the firelight module, but with a slightly faster frequency.


### LED string Module
A series of max 4 or 5 small-current LEDs. The maximum drop voltage must be less than $V_{out}$ minus a few volts.

Typical (but very very indicative) LED voltage drop, based on color, are:

$$ red \sim 1.6 - 2.0 $$

$$ orange \sim 2.0 $$

$$ yellow \sim 2.0 $$

$$ green \sim 1.9 - 4.0 $$

$$ blu \sim 2.5 - 3.7 $$

$$ white \sim 3.2 - 4.0 $$
